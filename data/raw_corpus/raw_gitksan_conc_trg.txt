A long time ago I lived overseas where the white people lived
And I found work in Stockholm that's what they call it
And I worked for IBM
After one year my friend and her husband and I traveled all the way to Spain
And on the way back we separated in Denmark
And I took the train and I went to Stockholm
And we arrived in Stockholm and I went home
And we were away a long time three weeks and that's why I didn't hear from Gigeenix
And I went to my work
But it was Sunday
And no one would be there
And I went there and I got my mail
And before I went home I had a short pee in the bathroom
And I don't know why I locked the door
And I was going to go out but the door didn't want to open
And I couldn't get out and whatever I tried I couldn't get out
And I laid on the floor for a while
I didn't know what to think I had no thoughts at all
And I hit the pipe I saw there was a pipe on the sink
And I took it apart and I hit the pole with the pipe in case anybody was around
But no one came
Because it was Sunday no one was at work
And my thoughts said I will be alright because there is running water
And there is nothing for me to fear here
And I laid down and tried to sleep
But no that's why I took the little pipe and I hit the door with it
And after a while I was able to see the outside of the bathroom
I made a big hole to go through and that's what I did
When I made it out then I put what I had done the rubble back in the bathroom
We went back to work and I wondered why the men kept coming into my office
And they said Oh this is the Canadanska flika Canadian girl who broke the toilet
When I was young our relative came over that lives in Gitsegyukla I was still young I was young when our relative came over in Gitsegyukla
We were still living at our mom and dad's house
And Man came over he was called Man Jacob Brown came over
He wants to tell the story of when he was hunting
And before he goes
And he gathers everything to use so he can catch what he's hunting
And he wants to tell us how he would do it
And he made us sit down he sat us down me and my brothers and sisters
And then he said I will tell you this
I was going to hunt and a grouse was there a grouse was in the way he said
And I saw the moose
I wanted to feed my village
And if I moved he said
the grouse would fly away and the moose that I want would run away
And Man didn't make a sound
He sat still he looked at us he looked at what we were doing he looked at how we were
And we asked what he did
What did you shoot A grouse or a moose
And then he sat down
And he said If I shoot the grouse
If I shoot the grouse I will be the only one to eat
And if I wait until the grouse walks away
Then I'll be able to walk right to to get real close to the moose
And then I will be able to shoot it and then all the people will eat
After he finished telling us he went home
And then after two days had passed I saw him again
And I ran toward him and I said to him
Can you tell what happened about the grouse
And then he said I will be over at your mom's house and I will tell you
And I went home and waited for him and then he told me about the grouse
'And when he was telling it the story and then he says
I was hunting and we wanted to get the moose
And we wanted to feed all the people but the grouse was in the way
If I moved the grouse would fly
Man said that the grouse started to fly and made the sound betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'
As soon as I moved he said as soon as I moved I broke a stick
It's noisy when the grouse flies and you can hear them when they fly betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'a betl' It's noisy when the grouse flies and when they fly you can hear it betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'
So I didn't want to move so that the moose my game will not run away because of the grouse being there
Every time I see Man I ask him Will you tell us the story about betl'a betl'
This is when Man named me Betl'a Betl'
That's why I am named Betl'a Betl' now
That's as much as I have to say
I will tell about when the white men first came to Kitwancool long ago
Not long after these people arrived they gathered together the people of Kitwancool
They wanted to tell about the new place where the village of Kitwancool is to be
The plan of the so-called government was that they will have Indian people live on a so-called reserve
Why the people of Kitwancool asked We live on our land here
They heard that what they call surveyors were coming
They will measure out the length of the perimeter of what is called the reserve
The people agreed that they wanted a big reserve which would encompass mountains starting from the Skeena all the way up to Meji'aadin They wanted that for a reserve
The Indian Agent disagreed the so-called Indian Agent who gathered the people together for the meeting
And the people of the village Kitwancool said If you don't do that then we don't want you to carve out a very small reserve
And now even though the people of Kitwancool said they did not want the little reserve We don't want to give away our land they said
And they told the Indian Agent to stop the surveyors they will chase away the surveyors
Even though Kitwancool said they did not want the reserve the surveyors apparently came back
They started measuring out the little settlement
So they stood by and watched after they told the surveyors It will not be right that you start
But the surveyors continued
One chief gathered together some people of the village and they said We will oppose them and we will chase them away
We will want the support of young men to help us
And that's what they did
They mobbed the surveyors
They took the measuring tape what we call tape in English
They took the tools surveyors' equipment what the surveyors' tools were called
And they completely chopped it up with axes
And they chased away the surveyors
Not long after the police came
They arrested people who they thought were around there when they destroyed the surveyors' tools
And they jailed them
After the police took away the men who destroyed the surveyors' tools the Kitwancool people still objected
We will absolutely oppose it
And there were maybe three chiefs who were jailed at what was known as Oakalla Prison
It wasn't recorded how many years they were incarcerated
While these chiefs were in prison the surveyors returned
They hurriedly measured out the tiny reserve that the Indian Agent gave Kitwancool
It's one mile by one mile we said
Because the surveyors were so afraid the villagers say today that they should not have made a surveyor's reserve
They never signed anything they said
That's it
