A long time ago I lived overseas where the white people lived
And I found work in Stockholm that's what they call it
And I worked for IBM
After one year my friend and her husband and I traveled all the way to Spain
And on the way back we separated in Denmark
And I took the train and I went to Stockholm
And we arrived in Stockholm and I went home
And we were away a long time three weeks and that's why I didn't hear from Gigeenix
And I went to my work
But it was Sunday
And no one would be there
And I went there and I got my mail
And before I went home I had a short pee in the bathroom
And I don't know why I locked the door
And I was going to go out but the door didn't want to open
And I couldn't get out and whatever I tried I couldn't get out
And I laid on the floor for a while
I didn't know what to think I had no thoughts at all
And I hit the pipe I saw there was a pipe on the sink
And I took it apart and I hit the pole with the pipe in case anybody was around
But no one came
Because it was Sunday no one was at work
And my thoughts said I will be alright because there is running water
And there is nothing for me to fear here
And I laid down and tried to sleep
But no that's why I took the little pipe and I hit the door with it
And after a while I was able to see the outside of the bathroom
I made a big hole to go through and that's what I did
When I made it out then I put what I had done the rubble back in the bathroom
We went back to work and I wondered why the men kept coming into my office
And they said Oh this is the Canadanska flika Canadian girl who broke the toilet
