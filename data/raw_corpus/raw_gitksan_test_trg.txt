I will tell about when the white men first came to Kitwancool long ago
Not long after these people arrived they gathered together the people of Kitwancool
They wanted to tell about the new place where the village of Kitwancool is to be
The plan of the so-called government was that they will have Indian people live on a so-called reserve
Why the people of Kitwancool asked We live on our land here
They heard that what they call surveyors were coming
They will measure out the length of the perimeter of what is called the reserve
The people agreed that they wanted a big reserve which would encompass mountains starting from the Skeena all the way up to Meji'aadin They wanted that for a reserve
The Indian Agent disagreed the so-called Indian Agent who gathered the people together for the meeting
And the people of the village Kitwancool said If you don't do that then we don't want you to carve out a very small reserve
And now even though the people of Kitwancool said they did not want the little reserve We don't want to give away our land they said
And they told the Indian Agent to stop the surveyors they will chase away the surveyors
Even though Kitwancool said they did not want the reserve the surveyors apparently came back
They started measuring out the little settlement
So they stood by and watched after they told the surveyors It will not be right that you start
But the surveyors continued
One chief gathered together some people of the village and they said We will oppose them and we will chase them away
We will want the support of young men to help us
And that's what they did
They mobbed the surveyors
They took the measuring tape what we call tape in English
They took the tools surveyors' equipment what the surveyors' tools were called
And they completely chopped it up with axes
And they chased away the surveyors
Not long after the police came
They arrested people who they thought were around there when they destroyed the surveyors' tools
And they jailed them
After the police took away the men who destroyed the surveyors' tools the Kitwancool people still objected
We will absolutely oppose it
And there were maybe three chiefs who were jailed at what was known as Oakalla Prison
It wasn't recorded how many years they were incarcerated
While these chiefs were in prison the surveyors returned
They hurriedly measured out the tiny reserve that the Indian Agent gave Kitwancool
It's one mile by one mile we said
Because the surveyors were so afraid the villagers say today that they should not have made a surveyor's reserve
They never signed anything they said
That's it
