When I was young our relative came over that lives in Gitsegyukla I was still young I was young when our relative came over in Gitsegyukla
We were still living at our mom and dad's house
And Man came over he was called Man Jacob Brown came over
He wants to tell the story of when he was hunting
And before he goes
And he gathers everything to use so he can catch what he's hunting
And he wants to tell us how he would do it
And he made us sit down he sat us down me and my brothers and sisters
And then he said I will tell you this
I was going to hunt and a grouse was there a grouse was in the way he said
And I saw the moose
I wanted to feed my village
And if I moved he said
the grouse would fly away and the moose that I want would run away
And Man didn't make a sound
He sat still he looked at us he looked at what we were doing he looked at how we were
And we asked what he did
What did you shoot A grouse or a moose
And then he sat down
And he said If I shoot the grouse
If I shoot the grouse I will be the only one to eat
And if I wait until the grouse walks away
Then I'll be able to walk right to to get real close to the moose
And then I will be able to shoot it and then all the people will eat
After he finished telling us he went home
And then after two days had passed I saw him again
And I ran toward him and I said to him
Can you tell what happened about the grouse
And then he said I will be over at your mom's house and I will tell you
And I went home and waited for him and then he told me about the grouse
'And when he was telling it the story and then he says
I was hunting and we wanted to get the moose
And we wanted to feed all the people but the grouse was in the way
If I moved the grouse would fly
Man said that the grouse started to fly and made the sound betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'
As soon as I moved he said as soon as I moved I broke a stick
It's noisy when the grouse flies and you can hear them when they fly betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'a betl' It's noisy when the grouse flies and when they fly you can hear it betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'a betl'
So I didn't want to move so that the moose my game will not run away because of the grouse being there
Every time I see Man I ask him Will you tell us the story about betl'a betl'
This is when Man named me Betl'a Betl'
That's why I am named Betl'a Betl' now
That's as much as I have to say
